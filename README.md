I have recreated a basic 3-slide of the Amazon webpage .
The first slide features the homepage with the navigation bar, search bar, and main product banners.
The second slide displays the sign-in page with input fields for user credentials.
The third slide highlights the "See More" section, focusing on various home appliances for easy browsing.
